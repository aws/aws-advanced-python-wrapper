# Using the AWS Advanced Python Driver

The AWS Advanced Python Driver leverages community Python drivers and enables support of AWS and Aurora functionalities.
Currently, [Psycopg](https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg) and [MySQL Connector/Python](https://github.com/mysql/mysql-connector-python) are supported.

## Using the AWS Advanced Python Driver with plain RDS databases

It is possible to use the AWS Advanced Python Driver with plain RDS databases, but individual features may or may not be compatible. For example, failover handling and enhanced failure monitoring are not compatible with plain RDS databases and the relevant plugins must be disabled. Plugins can be enabled or disabled as seen in the [Connection Plugin Manager Parameters](#connection-plugin-manager-parameters) section. Please note that some plugins have been enabled by default. Plugin compatibility can be verified in the [plugins table](#list-of-available-plugins).

## AWS Advanced Python Driver Parameters

These parameters are applicable to any instance of the AWS Advanced Python Driver.

## Plugins

The AWS Advanced Python Driver uses plugins to execute database API calls. You can think of a plugin as an extensible code module that adds extra logic around any database API calls. The AWS Advanced Python Driver has a number of [built-in plugins](#list-of-available-plugins) available for use. 

Plugins are loaded and managed through the Connection Plugin Manager and may be identified by a `str` name in the form of plugin code.

It helps to eliminate opening wrong connections to an old writer node after cluster failover is completed. <br><br> :warning:**Note:** This logic is already included in `failover` plugin so you can omit using both plugins at the same time. | None                                                                 |
